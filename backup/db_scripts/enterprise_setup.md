# Enterprise Database Setup Guidelines

## Real-World Database Management Approach

In enterprise environments like Staples, database creation and management typically follows a different approach than what's represented in our current `setup_database.sql` script. Here's how it's usually handled:

### One-Time Database Creation Process

1. **Database environments are created once** by database administrators (DBAs) or operations teams
2. **Application teams request database resources** through proper channels, not by running scripts directly
3. **Schema migrations are managed through a controlled process**, often involving:
   - Change management approval
   - Deployment windows
   - Rollback strategies

### Recommended Enterprise Approach

#### 1. Initial Database Setup (Done by DBAs)

For each environment (dev, QA, staging, prod):
- Create database instance with proper sizing and configuration
- Set up appropriate security measures and access controls
- Configure backup, monitoring, and high availability solutions
- Create application user with appropriate privileges

#### 2. Schema Management (Done by Application Team)

- Use a migration framework (such as Alembic or Flask-Migrate)
- Version control all schema changes
- Apply migrations through the deployment pipeline
- Never drop/recreate the database in higher environments

#### 3. Environment-Specific Configuration

- Store connection information securely (not in code)
- Use environment variables or secrets management tools
- Implement different connection settings by environment:
  - Dev/QA: May use direct connections
  - Staging/Prod: Often use connection pooling, read replicas

## Updated Approach for Staples Brain

### New Organization

1. **Database Creation**: A one-time process per environment
   - Document required resources
   - Request through appropriate enterprise channels
   - Receive connection details from DBAs

2. **Schema Versioning**:
   - Use Flask-Migrate or SQLAlchemy-Migrate for schema changes
   - Create incremental migrations for each schema change
   - Test migrations thoroughly in development before promoting

3. **Data Management**:
   - Implement data archiving and cleanup strategies
   - Provide tools for operations support
   - Create admin interfaces for data management

### Practical Implementation Steps

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Local developers can continue to use setup scripts
   - Document local setup clearly (including PostgreSQL installation)
   - Consider Docker containers for local database consistency

2. **Test/CI Environment**:
   - Use dedicated test databases
   - Reset before test runs
   - Use fixtures or seeded data for consistent testing

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Apply schema migrations via CD pipeline
   - Never run "setup" or "create" scripts directly
   - Include validation steps to verify migration success

## Migration from Current Approach

To transition from our current database management approach to a more enterprise-appropriate method:

1. Extract schema creation from `setup_database.sql` into proper migrations
2. Document the expected database configuration for each environment
3. Create a more realistic `README.md` that aligns with enterprise practices
4. Update application documentation to reflect proper database management processes

> Note: The current scripts should be clearly labeled as development-only tools, not for use in production environments.
