# Frontend Components

## Overview

This document describes the key UI components used in the Staples Brain frontend.

## Component Structure

The frontend uses a component-based architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components

- **ChatInterface**: Main chat interface for interacting with agents
- **MessageList**: Displays conversation history
- **MessageInput**: Allows users to input messages
- **AgentSelector**: Enables direct selection of agents
- **SystemStatus**: Displays system status information

### Admin Components

- **TelemetryDashboard**: Displays telemetry data
- **AgentBuilder**: Interface for building and configuring agents
- **SystemMetrics**: Shows system performance metrics

## Component Interactions

Components interact through a centralized state management system, with events flowing from user interactions to the backend API and back to the UI.

## Best Practices

- Components should be designed for reusability
- Each component should have a single responsibility
- State management should be handled through a central store
- API interactions should be abstracted into service classes
