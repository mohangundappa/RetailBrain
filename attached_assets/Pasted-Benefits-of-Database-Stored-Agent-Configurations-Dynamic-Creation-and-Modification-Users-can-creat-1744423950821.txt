Benefits of Database-Stored Agent Configurations
Dynamic Creation and Modification:

Users can create, edit, and delete agents without code changes
Real-time updates without application restarts
Supports wizard-driven flows and visual builders
Versioning and History:

Track changes to agent configurations over time
Rollback to previous configurations if needed
Compare agent performance across different versions
Environment-Specific Configurations:

Different configurations for development, staging, and production
Easy to clone agents between environments
Enhanced Collaboration:

Multiple users can work on different agents simultaneously
Clear ownership and access control
Database Schema Approach
We could design a schema with these key tables:

agents: Core agent metadata

- id (UUID)
- name (string)
- description (text)
- type (enum: LLM, rule-based, etc.)
- status (enum: active, draft, archived)
- created_at, updated_at, created_by
agent_configurations: Technical settings

- id (UUID)
- agent_id (foreign key)
- model_name (string, for LLM-based agents)
- confidence_threshold (float)
- timeout (integer)
- max_tokens (integer)
- temperature (float)
- version (integer)
- configuration (JSONB for flexible storage)
agent_patterns: Recognition patterns

- id (UUID)
- agent_id (foreign key)
- pattern_type (enum: regex, semantic, keyword)
- pattern_value (text)
- priority (integer)
- confidence_boost (float)
agent_prompts: Templates for agent behavior

- id (UUID)
- agent_id (foreign key)
- prompt_type (enum: system, user, few-shot)
- content (text)
- order (integer)
agent_tools: Tools/functions available to agents

- id (UUID)
- agent_id (foreign key)
- tool_name (string)
- tool_description (text)
- parameters (JSONB)
- enabled (boolean)
Implementation Strategy
To transition from hardcoded configurations to database-driven ones:

Repository Pattern: Create an AgentRepository that loads configurations from the database
Factory Pattern: Use an AgentFactory to instantiate agent objects from DB configurations
Loader Systems: Update the orchestrator to load agents from the database at startup
Registry Mechanism: Maintain a runtime registry of loaded agents that refreshes periodically
Migration Plan: Start with a hybrid approach where we migrate one agent type at a time
Admin Interface Considerations
For the wizard and drag-and-drop builder:

Component-Based UI: Allow assembling agents from building blocks
Visual Flows: Represent agent decision trees or prompt chains visually
Template Library: Provide pre-built agent templates for common use cases
Testing Console: Built-in testing against sample inputs
Metrics Dashboard: Show performance data for each agent
