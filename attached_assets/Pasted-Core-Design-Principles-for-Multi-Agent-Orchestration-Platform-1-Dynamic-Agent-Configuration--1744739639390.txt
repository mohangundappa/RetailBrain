Core Design Principles for Multi-Agent Orchestration Platform

1.  Dynamic Agent Configuration
        -   Agents and tools are defined in database-driven or JSON-configurable formats
        -   Enables dynamic provisioning, overrides, and A/B testing
2.  LLM-Based Orchestration & Routing
        -   Use zero-shot or few-shot prompting for task delegation and agent switching
        -   Avoid rigid, rule-based logic in orchestration
3.  Hierarchical Multi-Agent Collaboration
        -   Introduce meta-agents to coordinate planner, executor, and specialist agents
        -   Clearly define agent roles and responsibilities
4.  LLM-First Entity Extraction & Tool Execution
        -   Replace regex and static rules with LLM-driven extraction and decision-making
        -   Let the LLM determine when and how to invoke tools
5.  Scoped Memory with Mem0
        -   Context managed using scoped memory (session, task, agent)
        -   Support TTL (time-to-live) and memory lifecycle tagging
6.  Conversation Guardrails at All Levels
        -   Enforce guardrails at orchestration, agent, and tool levels
        -   Include hallucination checks, PII filters, and fallback detection
7.  Prompt Lifecycle Management
        -   Prompts are version-controlled and structured with templates
        -   Enable dynamic slot-filling and consistent prompt format
8.  Single Unified Chat Interface
        -   Centralized chat UI that routes across agents transparently to the user
        -   Maintains multi-turn continuity regardless of agent switch
9.  Support for Multi-Turn Recovery & Interruptions
        -   Handle user clarifications, context shifts, and conversation recovery
        -   Allow agents to pause, resume, and rewind conversations using memory
10. Logging, Traceability & Explainability
        -   Every agent/tool decision is logged with reasoning steps
        -   Enable developer dashboards to debug flows visually
11. Performance Monitoring & Retraining Signals
        -   Track metrics like success rate, retry rate, fallback usage
        -   Automatically flag underperforming agents for tuning
12. Persona-Based Behavioral Control
        -   Define agent personas (tone, formality, verbosity)
        -   Load behavior dynamically based on user profile or team
13. Code Quality & Cleanliness
        -   Aggressively remove hardcoded logic or legacy code not aligned with principles
        -   Enforce modular, testable, and clutter-free implementation
